# Dedrowse is a drowsiness detector

Dedrowse is a computer vision system that can automatically detect operator
drowsiness in a real-time video stream and raise an alarm if the operator seems
to be drowsy. A operator may be a truk driver or a crane operator, or long
distance driver. Or a elite athlete training in the cut-throut world of competitive
netflix binge watching.
